This TXT file is inside the Lib as a way to list and show the new types.
The types put inside "[]" after one of the Lib types are what it extends, meaning all the parameters
used for that type work for the new one as well, plus whatever other parameters are beneath it.
Any stats set are either defaults or there to help you get a grip on the code.
